Flask-OpenTracing
=================

This package enables distributed tracing in `Flask`_ applications via `The OpenTracing Project`_. Once a production system contends with real concurrency or splits into many services, crucial (and formerly easy) tasks become difficult: user-facing latency optimization, root-cause analysis of backend errors, communication about distinct pieces of a now-distributed system, etc. Distributed tracing follows a request on its journey from inception to completion from mobile/browser all the way to the microservices. 

As core services and libraries adopt OpenTracing, the application builder is no longer burdened with the task of adding basic tracing instrumentation to their own code. In this way, developers can build their applications with the tools they prefer and benefit from built-in tracing instrumentation. OpenTracing implementations exist for major distributed tracing systems and can be bound or swapped with a one-line configuration change.

Installation
------------

Install the extension with the following command::
    
    $ pip install Flask-OpenTracing

Usage
-----

All that is required is for a FlaskTracing tracer to be initialized using an
instance of an OpenTracing tracer. You can either trace all requests to your site, 
or use function decorators to trace certain individual requests.

**Note:** `optional_args` in both cases are any number of attributes (as strings) of `flask.Request` that you wish to set as tags on the created span

Trace All Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    import opentracing
    from flask_opentracing import FlaskTracing

    app = Flask(__name__)

    opentracing_tracer = ## some OpenTracing tracer implementation
    tracing = FlaskTracing(opentracing_tracer, True, app, [optional_args])

It is possible to exclude paths from tracing by adding them in the parameter `exluded_paths`:

.. code-block:: python
    tracing = FlaskTracing(opentracing_tracer, True, app, [optional_args], exluded_paths=['/metrics', '/healthz'])

Trace Individual Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    import opentracing
    from flask_opentracing import FlaskTracing

    app = Flask(__name__)

    opentracing_tracer = ## some OpenTracing tracer implementation  
    tracing = FlaskTracing(opentracing_tracer)

    @app.route('/some_url')
    @tracing.trace(optional_args)
    def some_view_func():
        ...     
        return some_view 

Accessing Spans Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to access the span for a request, we've provided an method `FlaskTracing.get_span(request)` that returns the span for the request, if it is exists and is not finished. This can be used to log important events to the span, set tags, or create child spans to trace non-RPC events. If no request is passed in, the current request will be used.

Tracing an RPC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to make an RPC and continue an existing trace, you can inject the current span into the RPC. For example, if making an http request, the following code will continue your trace across the wire:

.. code-block:: python

    @tracing.trace()
    def some_view_func(request):
        new_request = some_http_request
        current_span = tracing.get_span(request)
        text_carrier = {}
        opentracing_tracer.inject(span, opentracing.Format.TEXT_MAP, text_carrier)
        for k, v in text_carrier.iteritems():
            new_request.add_header(k,v)
        ... # make request

Examples
--------

See `examples`_ to view and run an example of two Flask applications
with integrated OpenTracing tracers.
